## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don’t worry: it’s perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you’ll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it’s not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they’ll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always *push* only to the *develop* branch!  The *master* branch will be ignored.  Work in the *src* directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III
## Why understand the methodology if I'm just here to code?

Let's imagine your first days at the company. You joined a team of developers, there are many unfamiliar people and new words around, there are meetings scheduled in the calendar, and as a possible result, you experience a lack of understanding of how everything works in this company at the initial stage.

The sooner you understand how the team is organized and what rules it plays by, and how the process of working on tasks is organized, the better you will fit into the team and the workflow.

Moreover, you will have an additional factor for rapid growth and you will be able to actively participate in the team's life and suggest improvements.

*Example:* A team that has been working successfully for a long time. It has been using one of the methodologies. A developer who didn't know it and didn't want to get into it joined this team. Out of a great desire to prove himself, he/she 
* starts coming up with new functions in addition to their tasks and immediately implementing them, which may not be needed by the customer; 
* stops going to team meetings because he/she doesn't understand why he/she's there; 
* tries to independently implement the entire functionality at once, rather than moving progressively and breaking the task into smaller ones.

Each member of the team is dependent on another, and therefore actions such as those described above can result in missed deadlines and lost money.

Thus, in order to avoid such incidents, a certain methodology is selected for each product/project development the team is working on, which will most effectively lead the team to a successful result.
Methodology is a set of approaches, practices and development models.

There are 2 main types of project management: Traditional and Agile.

1. The **traditional approach** is used when we already know exactly what product we want to get, and each next stage starts only upon completion of the previous one. The most common application of this type of method can be found in the construction and medical fields.  
One example of this approach is the Waterfall (cascade model) and the V-shaped model.

2. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditional approach, **agile methodologies** began to emerge and were combined into a single Agile philosophy - a set of 4 values and 12 development principles.

In what areas of your life or current job are you already applying Agile values? To answer the question, read the Agile Manifesto.

The most popular Agile approaches among IT specialists are Scrum and Kanban. Below we'll look at them in more detail.

Note that the cornerstone in Agile is **communication and interaction both within the team and with users.**  
For many people it may be something new: "Why should I tell the whole team about my tasks?", "Why should I analyze and tell everyone about my mistakes?", "Why do we need these meetings?”  
Such actions help teams become self-organized and produce a high-quality product that the market needs.

## Scrum Framework. What to be prepared for?
Scrum is a way of organizing workflow that is particularly popular with IT teams. It's very likely that you'll be working according to this framework.

The basic unit of Scrum is a self-organized and cross-functional team, which means that:

- all decisions are made taking into account everyone's opinion;
- the team decides who does what, how and when;
- the team has all the necessary skills to accomplish the goal.

Scrum is suitable for teams that are involved in product development. It is suitable when there is only a product idea, but no understanding of how to approach it, or there is a business goal, but no certainty about what will lead to it, or when no one can provide clear development plans. Scrum allows you to gradually overcome uncertainty by moving in **small iterations and constantly testing**: are we doing what our clients need? Does our work bring value?

SCRUM explicitly regulates values, distribution of roles, organization of events (meetings) and artifacts used during workflow. These rules of thumb are described in the Scrum guide.

![SCRUM](misc/images/CT04.01.png) 

Let's take a closer look at the Scrum Retrospective tool. This meeting is needed to reflect on the work done by all participants in order to plan quality or efficiency improvements. You will be conducting it as part of your current project. The algorithm for conducting a meeting consists of 5 steps:

1. Set the stage;
2. Gather data;
3. Generate insights;
4. Decide what to do;
5. Close the retrospective.

Learn [more](https://filipyev.ru/2018/07/25/pyat-shagov-restrospektivy-konceptualnaya-karta/) about the meeting. Use this [tool](https://retromat.org/ru/?id=114-35-74-100-109) to choose exercises for your retrospective.

## Use of the Kanban method. How to apply it in real life?
The Kanban method can be applied to any process you're involved in and make it more agile: at work, during study and in personal life. This is an evolutionary approach, meaning you don't have to rebuild anything in the team or implement everything at once to use it. You can start to apply the practices gradually. 

The essence of applying the Kanban method is to see how the current work process is organized, and then improve this process, make useful changes and correct ineffective ones.

Kanban offers 6 core practices.  
Let's analyze one of the practices:  
*Visualize.* All of our work needs to be visualized. This will allow us to see our entire current process, understand patterns of performance and suggest options for improvement. It is often the case that if a task is not written on the board, it probably won't be done. You should also visualize the rules by which the team operates. Therefore, visualization will help to see in one place and put in order all the large flow of incoming requests and inquiries.

Read more about these and [other practices](materials/Канбан.pdf)

The teams that use Kanban often have a Service Delivery Manager. This person is in charge of managing the flow of tasks in the Kanban system (he/she doesn’t hand out tasks manually) and removing obstacles in its path. He/she monitors the team metrics and helps the team plan improvements.

## Formal and informal rules of teamwork. What are they for?

You come into the team and figure out how it works and what the formal rules are.

For example, almost all teams have **task trackers** that help to practically implement SCRUM or Kanban methods. One of the popular services for task management is Jira (it was named after the Japanese monster Godzilla, which was a reference to the name of the competing product Bugzilla), because it allows to conveniently implement any of these frameworks using graphs and reports to observe the flow of tasks and the performance of teams. There is also a large set of plugins that you can add to enhance this tool. For example, the following will be examples of how the School 21 team Uses Jira for the SCRUM framework.

This is what the board looks like, showing all the tasks that are in the sprint and that we need to accomplish the sprint goal:

![Jira](misc/images/CT04.03.png) 

And below is an example of a product backlog, based on which the Product Owner can already allocate goals and tasks for sprints in advance.

![бэклога](misc/images/CT04.04.png) 

Such a tool allows you:

- to see the entire work process;
- to be focused on the goal of the sprint;
- to be part of a self-organized team;
- to keep track of where the team is falling behind and where there are challenges to overcome.

Implementing the Kanban method in a task tracker will help to apply several practices. What practices do you think you could use if you were a part of a Kanban-method team running a task tracker?

In addition to Jira, of course, there are many other handy online task boards. For example:

- Trello;
- Asana;
- Kaiten;
- Yandex.Tracker, etc.

Also, one of the formal rules of teamwork may be to maintain a corporate knowledge base. As the team works on the project, they gain new knowledge about its implementation, make mistakes, new arrangements, and so on. This knowledge is kept in one place for preservation and education of new employees. Often teams use Confluence to create team spaces and upload articles, documents and attachments. 

Don't be afraid to express yourself, ask questions, and suggest changes! Best of luck with your new job!

## Chapter IV
## Task 1

You need to spend the next week in the development team using popular practices like working with a task board and participating in retrospectives. Once you try them for yourself, you'll understand why they're needed. You'll also get a deeper understanding of how SCRUM is applied and take the test.

**Note!**  
You cannot complete Project 04 until you have completed individual projects Project 05 and 06. If you complete Project 04, you won't be able to do the following projects.

![SCRUM](misc/images/CT04.02.png) 

## Chapter V
## Exercise 00
### Create and maintain a team board with learning objectives
1. Create a board on any convenient platform for the whole team.
2. Place all tasks of the third block on this board and keep them updated. (Project 04, Project 05, Project 06). All team members must maintain them. Tasks may relate not only to specific assignments, but also to the study of relevant supplemental materials.
3. Make sure anyone can follow the link and see the task board.

## Exercise 01
### Conducting a team retrospective

1. After all participants have completed the tasks of each day (Project 05, Project 06), a retrospective must be held using the online board (Miro, Metroretro, Trello, etc.), according to the 5 stages of the meeting.
2. Each team member should practice the role of facilitator and participant. The meeting facilitator must prepare in advance. You need to plan each step, choose the exercise and the tool. Try to pick up different tools at each meeting so you don't repeat yourself and test all options.
3. One of the team meetings should be recorded and uploaded. You should capture the entire retrospective process and demonstrate all 5 steps.

The videos from the retrospective and the links to the boards should be uploaded. They must be clickable so that you can click on them and see the results of the discussions.

## Exercise 02
### Passing the SCRUM assessments
1. Each participant is required to take a [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) comprehension quiz.
2. The test result must be greater than 70%. The screenshot with the results must be attached. For better preparation, you can study the latest version of the [Scrum Guide](materials/Scrum_Guide.pdf) (available for download in the materials -> Scrum-Guide folder).
